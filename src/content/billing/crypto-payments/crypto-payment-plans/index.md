It is possible to pay for your plan using crypto. We take L1 and L2 payments.

You can send USDC or ETH to ⚡⚡⚡.eth (0x8F2F1D2d21d1E6dF7fEdb15179f4d98EAa0aa177)
It is required that you pay for a minimum of 6 months worth of the plan you've chosen.
Once that's done, you can submit a request letting us know the details of your payment, and it will be credited within 48 hours.

You can find more details about each different plan [here](/pricing).
