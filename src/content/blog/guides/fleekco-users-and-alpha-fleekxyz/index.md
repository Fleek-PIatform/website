The Fleek Alpha release is here! If youâ€™re coming from Fleek.co, you might be wondering: **Is this a test? Is it time to migrate? What should I do?**

To answer the most pressing questions and set clear expectations, weâ€™ve prepared a comprehensive FAQ for existing Fleek.co users. Hereâ€™s a TLDR if youâ€™re short on time:

- This first release of Fleek.xyz is a closed alpha test
- New and existing users can request access to the alpha in our [Discord](https://fleekxyz.typeform.com/alpha-access)
- This phase does not include Fleek.co migration tools, *yet*
- You will have to create a new account to authenticate, and you can use the same credentials you have on fleek.co to facilitate the migration process later.
- Using other credentials wonâ€™t hinder your migration process in the future
- Our version 1 of the platform will include a one-click migration process and will kickstart the sunsetting

Still have some questions? Keep reading.

## Is this alpha release of Fleek.xyz the time to migrate or to test?

The purpose of this Alpha release of Fleek.xyz is to test. While most functionality for feature parity is ready, this **closed alpha** release of Fleek has been designed to stress-test our infrastructure and test, **not to migrate apps fully just yet.**

We will be using this period to gather feedback, optimize performance of the platform, and polish the experience for our upcoming public V1 release. We want to make improvements with real testing usage.

*Testing! GLaDOS would be proud.*

Migration tools for Fleek.co users will go live with the release of the V1 version of the platform, coming this September. This will kickstart our sunsetting & migration process.

## As a Fleek.co user, can I participate in the Fleek.xyz closed alpha period?

**Of course you can, and you should**! Anyone can get whitelisted to try the alpha release. We hope you tinker as much as we can until the release of Version 1 of Fleek.xyz.

**[Visit our Discord to get whitelisted to access the alpha!](https://fleekxyz.typeform.com/alpha-access)**

## Can I sign into the alpha with my current Fleek.co credentials?

**To sign in to the alpha of Fleek.xyz you will need to create a new account**. Credentials from Fleek.co wonâ€™t work, as both sites are not connected yet: your alpha Fleek.xyz dashboard wonâ€™t have any of your sites, domains or files from Fleek.co.

## Should I sign up with a different email/wallet? Will it impact the migration process in the future?

To facilitate migration later in the future, **we recommend using the same method of signup in both Fleek.co and Fleek.xyz alpha**, but you can use any method (such as email or a wallet) you like.

**Our one-click migration will include a process to connect both accounts**, even if signup details are different.

## I still want to migrate my sites manually to this alpha platform. What can happen?

If you still want to test your Fleek.co site live on the alpha manually, we warn you: alpha is not a stable release (in the dev sense of the word). Things may change unexpectedly, or functionality could be missing. All manual migration should be done at your own risk.

## If I want to wait, when are V1 and the migration tools coming?

The public V1 of Fleek.xyz, **including a one-click migration for Fleek.co users, is coming in Q1 2024**. We absolutely recommend you to wait for our migration process to be ready! Weâ€™re planning to do it as easy as possible for you.

## Should I expect changes for Fleek.co now? Can I still create an account there?

You can still create an account on Fleek.co, and nothing will change on the platform until the sunsetting period starts. However, some functionalities have already been limited (such as storage) in preparation for the new platformâ€™s release.

## Some things to consider âš¡

This alpha of Fleek.xyz is a place to experience the new UI and to explore the new features. Whether you come with a totally fresh perspective or have big expectations coming from Fleek.co, **we encourage you to try it, break it, and have fun with it**.

**To have in mind:**

- Thereâ€™s a lot to tinker inside the Fleek.xyz alpha, so *go to town*! Deploy a site, upload files, test custom domains, and try the new features!
- Treat this alpha like any other non-stable release: good for testing and feedback, but be mindful with possible issues, bugs and downtime.
- **Have more questions?** **Found something weird?** The team has their ears on the ground to collect feedback, but youâ€™re more than welcome to follow and comment on all of our channels, such as [X](https://twitter.com/fleekxyz) & [Discord](https://discord.gg/fleek).

And finally: **thanks for helping us test, itâ€™s invaluable!** The Version 1 of Fleek.xyz will follow soon enough, so pay attention to our social channels for more information on that release.

Until then, enjoy and see you in the Alpha ðŸ¤™âš¡
