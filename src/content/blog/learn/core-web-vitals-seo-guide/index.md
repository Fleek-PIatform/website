Google's Core Web Vitals are metrics designed to measure a website's user experience. As Google continues prioritizing user experience in its search rankings, understanding and optimizing for Core Web Vitals has become essential for site owners looking to improve user experience and SEO.

## Understanding Core Web Vitals

Core Web Vitals are factors Google considers essential to a web page's user experience. As of 2024, Core Web Vitals consist of three main metrics:

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: Measures loading performance, represented by how long the largest content element takes to appear on the screen.
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP)**: Measures the time it takes for the next frame to be painted after a user interacts with the page. It reflects how quickly a webpage responds to user inputs like clicks, taps, or keyboard actions, indicating the overall responsiveness.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: CLS measures visual stability by adding together every unexpected layout shift that occurs during the page's lifespan.

Together, these metrics provide a holistic view of a user's experience when interacting with a webpage, from the initial load to the final interaction, providing an objective way to measure and compare websites.

## Why Core Web Vitals Matter for SEO

In the past, Google's search algorithms focused on factors like keyword density, backlinks, and content relevance. However, user experience has become increasingly important as the internet has evolved. Google wants to direct users to websites with relevant content and seamless, enjoyable interactions.

This is where Core Web Vitals come into play. By incorporating these metrics into its search ranking algorithms, Google signals that users are its top priority. Sites with better Core Web Vitals will likely rank higher than sites with a less satisfactory experience.

The benefits of optimizing for Core Web Vitals extend beyond SEO. A site with great Core Vitals on mobile and desktop devices will also benefit from:

- **Reduced bounce rates**: Users stay longer on sites that load quickly and respond to interactions promptly.
- **Increased engagement**: A fast and responsive site encourages users to explore further and interact more.
- **Higher conversion rates:** A smooth, frustration-free visit can lead to more conversions, whether filling out a form, purchasing a product, or subscribing to a service.

## Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

The Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) measures the time it takes for the most prominent element on a page to appear. That element could be an image, a video, or a text block.

LCP matters because it marks the point in the page load timeline when the main content has likely loaded, giving the user a sense that the page is useful and engaging.

Google considers LCP a key factor in user experience, as a slow-loading page can frustrate users and lead them to abandon the site.

According to Google's guidelines, a good LCP score is 2.5 seconds or less. Scores from 2.5 to 4 seconds need improvement, while scores over 4 seconds are considered poor.

Several factors can influence LCP, including:

- Server response times
- Render-blocking JavaScript and CSS
- Resource load times
- Client-side rendering

### Techniques for Optimizing the Largest Contentful Paint

**Image Optimization**

- Compress images to reduce file size.
- Specify image dimensions to prevent layout shifts.
- Use appropriate formats, such as JPEG for photographs and PNG for graphics.

**Improving Server Response Time**

- Upgrade to a faster server.
- Minimize the number of requests by consolidating files and resources.
- Use a content delivery network to put content closer to the end user.
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data.

**Prioritizing Above-the-Fold Content**:

- Ensure the most important content loads first.
- Use lazy loading for content further down the page so it loads only as the user scrolls.

## Interaction to Next Paint (INP)

Interaction to Next Paint (INP) is a relatively new metric that Google is introducing to replace First Input Delay (FID) as part of the Core Web Vitals. INP measures the latency of all user interactions with a page, providing a more comprehensive picture of a page's interactivity and responsiveness.

INP aims to capture a user's entire experience of a site's responsiveness. A site with a low INP consistently and quickly responds to interactions like clicks, taps, and key presses.

Like the other Core Web Vitals, INP directly impacts user experience. A sluggish or unresponsive site frustrates users, and frustrated users will go elsewhere. On the other hand, a site that provides a good experience encourages further exploration and interaction.

Google recommends an INP of 200 milliseconds or less. Anything over 500 milliseconds is considered poor and may negatively impact your search rankings.

### Techniques for Optimizing Interaction to Next Paint

**Minimize and Optimize JavaScript**

- Reduce the size of your JavaScript files.
- Split JavaScript code into smaller chunks.
- Defer non-critical scripts to prioritize essential tasks.

**Use Browser Caching**:

- Cache resources locally in the user's browser.
- Use Cache-Control headers to direct browser caching periods.
- Cache static resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript for a long duration (e.g., one year) since they change infrequently.
- Enhance the perceived responsiveness of your site.

**Reduce Main Thread Work**:

- Limit the amount of JavaScript running on the main thread to avoid blocking interactions.
- Use web workers to offload intensive tasks to background threads.

## Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) quantifies how much a page's layout unexpectedly shifts during its lifetime. A typical example of a layout shift is when you've started reading an article, and suddenly, the text moves down because an image or ad has loaded above it. This unexpected movement can be disorienting and frustrating for users.

Google considers pages with a CLS of 0.1 or less. Scores between 0.1 and 0.25 need improvement, while anything over 0.25 is considered poor.

Common causes of high CLS include:

- Dimensionless images, ads, embeds, iframes, and so on.
- Content injected after the page has loaded.
- Slow-loading web fonts that cause <u>[FOIT](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/foit)</u>/<u>[FOUT](https://fonts.google.com/knowledge/glossary/fout)</u>.
- DOM updates that require a high-latency network response.

### Techniques for Optimizing Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)

**Specify Size Attributes for Media**

- Always provide width and height attributes for images and video elements to ensure the browser can reserve the correct amount of space in the document, preventing unexpected page shifts during loading.
- Use the aspect-ratio CSS property to define the aspect ratio for images and videos, ensuring the correct space is reserved during loading.
- Reserve sufficient space in your layout for dynamically injected content, such as ads. Use fixed-size containers to prevent unexpected shifts when the content loads.

**Avoid loading or moving visible content after the page has loaded**

- Preload web fonts to avoid the flash of invisible text (FOIT). This ensures fonts are available when the page loads, minimizing layout shifts as the text appears smoothly.
- When new content is injected above existing content, it can cause a significant shift. Instead, add new content below or in reserved spaces.
- Animations can cause layout shifts. Use CSS transformations (e.g., scale, translate) instead of properties that trigger layout changes (e.g., top, left).

## A Note On First Input Delay (FID)

First Input Delay (FID) was a metric previously included in the Core Web Vitals. It measured the time from a user's first interaction to the time when the browser is actually able to begin processing event handlers in response.

<u>[Google has announced that FID](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/05/introducing-inp)</u> will be retired and replaced by Interaction to Next Paint (INP) as of March 12, 2024. The end of support for FID is scheduled for September 9, 2024.

This change is because FID only measures the first input delay, providing a limited view of a page's overall interactivity. INP, on the other hand, measures the latency of all responses, giving a more comprehensive picture of the user's experience.

While FID will no longer be a Core Web Vital, the principles behind optimizing for FID, such as minimizing main thread work and reducing JavaScript execution time, remain relevant for optimizing INP.
