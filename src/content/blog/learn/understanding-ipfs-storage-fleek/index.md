<u>[InterPlanetary File System](https://ipfs.tech/)</u> (IPFS) represents a paradigm shift in data storage and retrieval, offering an onchain approach that enhances data security, integrity, and availability. As data storage needs evolve, IPFS presents a robust alternative to traditional centralized systems, aligning with the growing trend towards going onchain in the digital world.

## **What is IPFS storage?**

IPFS is a peer-to-peer network protocol designed to create a distributed file system. Unlike traditional centralized storage, where data is stored on specific servers, IPFS allows files to be stored across multiple nodes, making data retrieval more efficient and resilient. The core idea behind IPFS is to use <u>[content addressing](https://fleek.xyz/blog/learn/understanding-content-identifiers-ipfs-onchain-hosting-and-storage/)</u>, where each file is identified by a unique hash, ensuring data integrity and immutability.

### **Core concepts**

- **Content addressing**: Files in IPFS are identified by their content rather than their location. This means each file has a unique cryptographic hash.
- **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)**: IPFS uses DHT to locate files across the network, enabling efficient data retrieval.
- **File versioning**: IPFS supports versioning, allowing users to track changes and updates to files.

## **How does IPFS storage work?**

IPFS breaks down data into smaller chunks and distributes them across various nodes in the network. When a file is requested, the network retrieves the chunks from the nearest or fastest nodes and reassembles them. This process ensures high availability and fault tolerance. The use of a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) enables efficient locating of files within the network.

### **Step-by-step process**

1. **Adding files**: When a file is added to IPFS, it is divided into smaller blocks, each given a unique hash.
2. **Storing files**: These blocks are distributed and stored across multiple nodes.
3. **Retrieving files**: When a file is requested, IPFS uses the unique hash to find and retrieve the blocks, reassembling them into the original file.

## **Benefits of IPFS storage**

### **Onchain**

IPFS eliminates single points of failure by distributing data across a network of nodes. This onchain architecture enhances data resilience and availability.

### **Data integrity and security**

IPFS uses content addressing, which ensures that each file is identified by its unique hash. This makes the data tamper-proof, as any modification changes the hash, signaling a difference in the content.

### **Cost efficiency**

By leveraging unused storage space across the network, IPFS can reduce storage costs compared to traditional centralized storage solutions. Users can utilize existing resources more effectively.

### **Resilience and availability**

IPFS increases data availability by storing copies of data across multiple nodes. If one node goes down, the data can still be retrieved from another node, ensuring continuous accessibility.

## **Use cases of IPFS storage**

### **Fleek's adoption of onchain storage**

<u>[Fleek](https://fleek.xyz/blog/announcements/fleek-move-to-decentralized-storage/)</u> has transitioned from centralized storage to a onchain setup using IPFS, Filecoin, and Arweave. This shift enhances data availability and aligns with the principles of Web3. By separating IPFS content addressing from the storage layer, Fleek benefits from improved cost efficiency and reliability, ensuring that their web services remain robust and scalable.

**Key benefits for Fleek:**

- **Enhanced data availability**: By using an onchain storage model, Fleek ensures that data is always accessible, even if some nodes are down.
- **Alignment with Web3 principles**: Onchain storage aligns with the core principles of Web3, promoting a more open and democratic internet.
- **Cost efficiency**: Leveraging onchain storage can reduce operational costs compared to traditional centralized storage solutions.

**How Fleek implemented IPFS:**

- **Separation of IPFS content addressing and storage**: Fleek uses IPFS for content addressing and Filecoin and Arweave for the storage layer.
- **Improved scalability**: The onchain approach allows Fleek to scale its storage needs more efficiently.

## **IPFS storage vs. traditional storage**

| **Feature**     | **IPFS storage**                               | **Traditional storage**                 |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Architecture    | Onchain                                        | Centralized                             |
| Data retrieval  | From multiple nodes                            | From specific servers                   |
| Fault tolerance | High (distributed)                             | Lower (single points of failure)        |
| Cost            | Potentially lower (leveraging network storage) | Higher (dedicated infrastructure)       |
| Security        | High (content-addressed, tamper-proof)         | Variable (dependent on server security) |

### **In-depth comparison**

- **Scalability**: IPFS allows for seamless scalability by adding more nodes to the network. Traditional storage often requires significant infrastructure investment to scale.
- **Latency**: While IPFS can offer high availability, it may sometimes face higher latency compared to centralized storage due to the distributed nature of the network.
- **Redundancy**: IPFS inherently provides redundancy by storing multiple copies of data across different nodes. Traditional storage often requires additional configurations for redundancy.

## **Challenges and considerations**

### **Network speed**

The speed of IPFS can be dependent on the number and location of nodes storing the data. In areas with fewer nodes, data retrieval might experience higher latency.

### **Adoption**

Widespread adoption of IPFS is essential to maximize its efficiency and benefits. As more users join the network, the performance and availability of IPFS improve.

### **Data privacy**

While IPFS ensures data integrity, data stored on public IPFS nodes is accessible to anyone with the file hash. Users need to implement encryption for sensitive data to maintain privacy.

### **Future developments**

Ongoing research and development in the IPFS ecosystem aim to address these challenges. Initiatives such as improving network protocols and enhancing data encryption methods are continuously evolving.
