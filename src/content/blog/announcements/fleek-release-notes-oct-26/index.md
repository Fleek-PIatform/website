Itâ€™s that time again! Weâ€™re back for another bi-weekly update to the Fleek.xyz Alphaâ€“ this time with a new template option, faster file uploads, a few new features, and fixes.

Application form for the next batch of testers, who will get onboarded with v0.0.3 coming in ~2 weeks, is open [here](https://fleekxyz.typeform.com/alpha-access)!

Letâ€™s get into the changes coming to the Fleek.xyz alpha with v0.0.2:

---

## Primary Domains

In an effort to simplify domain management, we're introducing a new "Primary Domains" feature. **The platform will now automatically reference your chosen primary domain for tasks related to sites or gateways**. When you set up your first active domain, it becomes the default primary. As you add more domains, you have the flexibility to set a new one that your site defaults to.

If you decide to switch things up and remove your primary domain, youâ€™ll get a prompt to set up a new one from your list of domains.

## Lens Template

Head over to the templates page to try our new Lens template! **Spin up your own fully functioning Lens social app in minutes with an easy-to-configure and customized template**. Start with a timeline, as well as post and user search, and build from there.

You can access the new template [here](https://app.fleek.xyz/templates/)- give us a tag on [X](https://twitter.com/fleekxyz) with your finished Lens build âš¡

## Upload Improvements

You may have noticed uploads on the platform feel faster over the last weekâ€“ thatâ€™s because we did a little refactoring on the backend and gave upload speeds a pretty significant boost! **Files of all sizes upload ~10 times faster than before on the UI** ðŸ¤™

## Other Fixes and Improvements

As always, weâ€™ve squashed a ton of bugs and added a few small improvements with this release! For the full list, head to our [docs](https://docs.fleek.xyz/release-notes/release-notes-0.0.2):

- Increased memory in our deploy lambda to accommodate bigger site repositories
- Fixed a bug where the IPNS values were not being updated after a deployment
- Fixed a bug where the GitHub listener was not catching all the commits for deployments
- Improved error handling when the user is not using the default Fleek configuration files while deploying with GitHub Actions
- Created a canary project to monitor site deployment flow for better customer support and availability
- Fixed an error where we were showing the incorrect message when a site name was not available
- Fixed an issue with some users getting stuck in the welcoming screen
- Added an auto-generated domain on the site overview if there is no domain set
- Fixed a bug where the view site button on the recent deployment cards was not working
