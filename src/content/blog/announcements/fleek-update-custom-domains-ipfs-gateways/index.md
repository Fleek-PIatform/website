## Private IPFS Gateways: Connecting Custom Domains

With this update, we're giving you more options for your storage gateway. Before, when storing files through the Fleek CLI, you'd get an IPFS.io.cid URL to access the content, using a shared IPFS gateway to view/resolve files.

Now, you can set up a custom domain for a private gateway for another layer of:

- **Privacy & Branding**: Only your content is served, and you are not responsible for the content of others on the same gateway.
- **Reliability & Performance**: Unlike public gateways, which are resource-locked, we provide a consistent file propagation experience.

**The gateways will only serve your user-uploaded content, and you can also whitelist the domains that you work with**. The big takeaway from this: private gateways are now faster and offer a more personalized & secure experience.
