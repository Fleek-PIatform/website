As we get ready for an exciting 2024, all the Fleek Freaks out there should take note of a significant change on the horizon: **We'll be sunsetting Fleek.co & fully migrating to Fleek.xyz towards the middle/end of Q1 2024.** This transition marks more than just a domain change– it’s a significant move towards a more robust, resilient, and web3-aligned platform.

**IMPORTANT: This is just an early warning, and there is no action you need to take this year.** We just wanted to give plenty of heads up so everyone is aware of the changes coming in the new year.

Let’s go over some information you need to know to prepare:

## Key Migration Details

The whole migration process will take less than a minute and our goal is to create a seamless transition with minimal disruption to your workflow:

- A simple 1-click migration process will be available for transferring all accounts, sites, and files from Fleek.co to Fleek.xyz well in advance of the official sunsetting.
- Upon the official sunsetting deadline, any remaining Fleek.co accounts, sites, and files will be auto-migrated (so nothing is lost in the move).
- After you migrate (either before or after official sunsetting of Fleek.co), accessing/managing your accounts, sites, and files on Fleek.xyz will be exactly the same.

Stay tuned for more information, as well as the rollout of tools and guides to help you migrate, coming at the start of 2024.

### Fleek.co SDK Deprecation

As part of the migration to Fleek.xyz and sunsetting of Fleek.co, the Fleek.co Storage SDK will also be sunset. This means that aside from migrating accounts, sites, and files, developers will also want to switch any previous references to the Fleek.co SDK in their codebase to the new Fleek.xyz SDK to ensure their applications and projects continue to operate at full functionality without any hiccups post official sunsetting and deprecation of Fleek.co.

Guides on how to do this will be available in the new year 🤙

Throughout the migration, we will make sure you have all the tools, information, and time to make the change comfortably and confidently. Expect to see detailed guides and white glove support on both manual and automated migration options. As mentioned, the whole process will be as quick and simple as the click of a button.

For those who want to get familiar with the new Fleek.xyz platform early, feel free to reach out and we’ll get you access to the beta. For the latest updates and support through this process, join our Discord community: [discord.gg/fleek](http://discord.gg/fleek)

We have a lot of big and exciting plans for the Fleek.xyz platform, so we are super excited for everyone to migrate over in the coming months– see you in the new year for a Fleektastic 2024 ⚡
