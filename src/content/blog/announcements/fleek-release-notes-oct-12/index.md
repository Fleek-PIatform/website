Weâ€™re back with another Alpha update, this time with a focus on laying down the foundation for an even more reliable platform and some new incoming features. Plus, if youâ€™ve been hanging out on our alpha waitlist, weâ€™ve got some good news: **youâ€™ll be approved tomorrow**â€“ keep an eye on your email for onboarding instructions!

If this is the first youâ€™re hearing of the alpha, donâ€™t worry our [application form is still open](https://fleekxyz.typeform.com/alpha-access), and weâ€™ll approve the next batch of users with the next release.

Letâ€™s get into the changes coming to the Fleek.xyz alpha with v0.0.1:

---

## New Feature

### Custom URL Slugs

The randomly generated on-fleek.app URL slugs will default to a combination of words but now, if you want something a little more personalized, you can change it to whatever available slug you want:

<video width="100%" height="auto" autoplay loop>
 <source src="./slug-change-prd.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

## Fixes & Improvements

### Validations

Weâ€™ve given our validation system a little tune-up in this updateâ€“ now youâ€™ll get a heads-up if the username or domain youâ€™re entering has already been claimed or is in use in a previous project, as well as alerts on storage limits and other key notifications.

### Other Improvements

- Added `Trigger Deploy` button in site detail
- Fixed SDK next.js installation issues
- Fixed an issue where CLI Users were unable to create a project
- Fixed site previews for pull requests
- Added option to cancel deployment that is already in progress
- `Copy Filecoin Deal ID` now copies the correct value
- Fixed bug where all the branches were not listed in the deployment process
- Now tracking how many times each template has been used
- Added new AR token balance monitors
- Streamlined support process now no longer needs users to provide details on things like Private Gateways, Project Members, Filecoin & Arweave file info, and other project/site details, when reaching out for support

That's not all thoughâ€“ head [here](https://docs.fleek.xyz/release-notes/release-notes-0.0.1) for a full list of the 50+ other changes and improvements coming to the Fleek.xyz Alpha with this release.

## Coming Next

- **Template Creation Flow**: Instead of our initially planned submission process, users will be able to make a site template from any previously deployed Fleek site.
- **Delete Options**: Adding options to better manage sites and projects, like account, project, and site deletion.
