The day is finally hereâ€“ the first step of the new [Fleek](https://fleek.xyz/), both app and brand âš¡

Letâ€™s set the stage: **This is not the full release of the new [Fleek app](http://app.fleek.xyz/).** Today marks the start of our **initial closed testing phase**, leading up to an open testing period, and **later in September the full v1 release** of the new app.

We wanted to draw a line in the sand in August to go public with a release, and force us to start gathering feedback early, and stress-test the platform before opening up with migration tools to move from Fleek.co.

Itâ€™s an early release, not final, and it will be iterated upon. And thatâ€™s where testers come in to help âš¡**Hereâ€™s how to join as a tester.**

### Become an Alpha Tester

We're opening the app for users to test it and provide feedback during this closed alpha period. **Applications start today on Discord! We will start approving and welcoming testers to use the app over the coming days!**. Itâ€™s super easy to get involved:

1. **Apply**: Apply [Here](https://fleekxyz.typeform.com/alpha-access)
2. **Hold: The team will approve your submission and notify you in our [Discord Server's](https://discord.gg/fleek) #Whitelisted channel!**
3. **Learn**: Check out our [documentation](https://docs.fleek.xyz) early to get prepared.
4. **Test**: Once approved, sign up to the [platform](https://fleek.xyz/) and tell us what you think on Discord.

**Itâ€™s important to note:** that you can apply with an email, or a wallet, and you need to sign up with the same wallet once approved.

As an alpha tester, get early access to a few familiar features weâ€™ve been improving for the release of the new platform. Here's a quick overview of what you can start testing on as soon as approved.

## Closed Alpha Features: Hosting, Templates, Storage, Gateways

### Hosting

Get a web3 app live on web3 infrastructure, Fleekâ€™s bread and butter. Connect your git provider, input your build details, and deploy a site as fast as Fleek, now backed to Filecoin/Arweave and served via IPFS. Deploy a site of your own or **try one of our templates**, directly on the new UI.

### ENS, DNS, IPNS

Configure ENS domains to serve as access points for your sites on Fleek, with automatic and gasless updates; or a traditional DNS. You can also create and manage IPNS records, changing the associated hashes on-demand.

### Storage & Gateways

Store your files on Fleek! **Upload files & folders, and try our new decentralized storage layer, using Arweave/Filecoin as the base layer, with a common IPFS addressability layer on top**. This includes setting up custom gateways to access your storage content.

### Templates

A newcomer to the platform, templates! Kick-start your new decentralized app with a boilerplate, or one of our use-case templates. **Pick from our library, and soon build your own and submit it to our templates hub for the community** **to use.**

## A Note to Fleek.co Users

Fleek.co users might be wondering about what will happen to their projects when we make the transition from Fleek.co to Fleek.xyz. **Donâ€™t worryâ€“ nothing is changing right now. Simple migration tools and guides will come a little later down the road in September to help you onboard**. In the meantime, apply to become a tester and get an early preview of the new and improved platform.

## Wrapping it Up

Remember, **what you're seeing now is just the closed alpha of Fleek.xyz**. If you donâ€™t end up getting approved for this closed testing period, donâ€™t worry! The open V1 is just around the corner, with the full release of the platform following shortly after in September.
