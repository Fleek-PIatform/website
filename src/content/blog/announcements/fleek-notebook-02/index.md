Whatâ€™s up Fleek Freaks? Weâ€™re back with another Fleek Release Notes, giving yâ€™all a look into the improvements and bug fixes weâ€™ve implemented into the Fleek.xyz alpha over the last week. If you missed the previous Fleek Release Notes, get caught up [here](https://blog.fleek.xyz/post/fleek-notebook-01/)!

This week, the focus was mainly on some bug fixes, visual improvements, and foundational work for upcoming features like site deletion/template submission. *Donâ€™t forget*: if you want to take part in the Fleek.xyz alpha, join our discord server and fill out [the application](https://fleekxyz.typeform.com/alpha-access) so you can join in the testing âš¡

Letâ€™s dive into the updates, shall we?

## New Features

### UI & Experience:

We heard your feedback and have spent the week making dark mode the default, with some other improvements sprinkled in:

1) Dark Mode is now set as the Default UI Theme:

## Fixes

### UI & Experience:

This week, the frontend team worked on fixing several bugs from the interface, which include:

- Fixed site breadcrumbs to remove 304 redirect errors while navigating
- The flow to accept an invite [without having a Fleek account](https://docs.fleek.xyz/docs/Accounts) has been now implemented
- When logged out and visiting the templates page, if the user logins it now redirects them this section after doing so
- Added 150-character-max to Environment variables in sites
- Removed the redeploy option from [self-managed deployment sites](https://docs.fleek.xyz/docs/Sites/self-hosted#setting-up-a-self-managed-deployment)
- Fixed `Go to Docs` button typo after CLI login
- Improved image caching and loading across the app
- Fixed issue with Fleek logo glitching on Templates pages
- Added extra information in the gateway for users to understand how to access their files
- Added a 1GB per file/folder maximum size validation in storage UI
- Fixed issue where a projectâ€™s GitHub app configurations persisted even when changing projects

## Inner-workings

While on the UI/user-facing front our updates end with the above, we have also been setting foundational work and improvements to the inner workings of Fleek.xyz, which prepare the platform for a couple of future releases:

- The base for the site and project deletion features have been set, and integrations can begin next.
- As well as the flow for community template submissions, with build settings validation, in preparation for integration of the feature to the frontend.

## Coming Next Release

- **Template submissions: Opening template submissions to the community**
- Site and project deletion
- Trackers for how many sites have been created for each template
- Adding custom build command and publish directory to templates
- Fixing Site previews

Thatâ€™s all for this time! Just a small update to smooth out a few issues spotted by our first groups of testers. Weâ€™ll be back with Fleek Release Notes 03 after another week in the lab ðŸ¤™
