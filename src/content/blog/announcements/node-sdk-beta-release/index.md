We’re excited to announce that the beta for our **Node SDK is now live**, and ready for developers to start integrating Fleek’s services!

Let’s dive into this release, and do a rundown of what you can build and achieve with the Node SDK today. Find a detailed guide on how to use it in [our SDK documentation](https://docs.fleek.xyz/docs/SDK/).

## The Fleek Node.js SDK

![](./nodejs-code.png)

First in our Beta came the CLI, an interface to use Fleek.xyz’ services from the command-line helping developers do quick storage operations or site deployments through Fleek.

Now, comes our Node SDK, making these services, and more to come, **embeddable into any Node.js experience or application**! Meaning you can build applications that leverage **these services as the underlying infrastructure**, or to power use cases for users themselves.

Currently, we are surfacing **IPFS Storage, IPNS management, and project management only in node environments**. Web browser support is not part of this release, though it will be part of future iterations.

In the case of Node.js, **that applies to any app with a Node.js backend**. The only thing you need is to request a Personal Access Token from the CLI to authorize your app to leverage your Fleek services, and integrate away!

What can you achieve? For example, you could build a desktop web3 game that **integrates the SDK to store your user’s progress data on IPFS**, or an NFT minting application web app with a Node.js backend that stores the user’s NFT collection metadata and images on web3 storage automatically!

### Getting Started with the SDK

Visit our new [SDK documentation](https://docs.fleek.xyz/docs/SDK/) page to learn how to install, integrate, and leverage Fleek via this interface. To get started run:

    npm install -g @fleek-platform/sdk

To setup and authenticate your SDK you will need to create a Personal Access Token via the [Fleek CLI](https://docs.fleek.xyz/docs/SDK/#personal-access-token-service), as so:

    > fleek pat create
    WARN! Fleek CLI is in beta, use it at your own discretion
    > Please follow this link to log in to Fleek.
    > https://app.fleek.xyz/login/200e4c811d843dd7c5f29af12765c5af
    > Success! Your new personal access token is: your-personal-access-token
