In our platform, users have the flexibility to enhance their login experience by linking wallets and emails to their accounts. This feature is designed to provide a seamless and secure way of accessing accounts, catering to the diverse preferences of our users.

### Account Linking Limitations

It is important to note that each account is limited to having only one email and one wallet linked. This limitation ensures the security and uniqueness of each account, preventing any conflicts or confusions that may arise from multiple links.

### How to Link a Wallet or Email

To link a wallet or an email, users should navigate to the 'Log In Connections' section found within the account settings. This area is dedicated to managing all aspects of your login connections.

#### Adding an Ethereum Wallet
