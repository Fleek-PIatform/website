### Host an app

Fleek’s hosting services allow users to easily upload, maintain, store and serve static sites.

#### Use an existing repo

Your existing project can be any web project that outputs static HTML content (such as a website that contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). When you use any of Fleek’s supported frameworks, we'll automatically detect and set the optimal build and deployment configurations for your framework.

    </ButtonGray>

</div>

#### Use a template

Choose from simple frameworks to comprehensive starter kits. These templates provide a solid foundation, allowing for flexibility and easy adaptation as your project develops. Explore the options available to streamline your development process.
