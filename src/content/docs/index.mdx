# Quick start

The simplest and fastest way to get up and running with Fleek from scratch is with the Fleek CLI tool. In the next steps, we're going to install the CLI, create a project and deploy a simple page.

To install the CLI launch your terminal and run:

```sh
npm install -g @fleekxyz/cli
```

## Login to the Fleek Platform

Setup a new account in Fleek Platform by running the command:

```sh
fleek login
```

Once logged in to the Fleek Platform via the browser, go back to the terminal. Alternatively, we have an intuitive UI to help you deploy a project.

## Create a project

Let's create a project where you'll deploy a simple page. Run the following command:

```sh
fleek projects create
```

## Set up a simple page

We'll need to have a page to deploy, so make a new directory in your favourite location. For our example, we've used ~/fleek-quick-start.

```sh
mkdir ~/fleek-quick-start
```

Change directory to the newly created directory.

```sh
cd ~/fleek-quick-start
```

Create a simple html page inside **~/fleek-quick-start**.

```
echo "Hello world" > index.html
```

## Setup a Fleek project site

Before deploying the page to Fleek, you must setup a Fleek project site.

Run the command and complete the CLI steps.

```sh
fleek sites init
```

Enter a name for the new Fleek site.

```sh
? Enter the name of your new site:
```

In the context of Node.js, you'll need to select the directory from which the site will be deployed. You might already be familiar with the most widely used JavaScript frameworks, which typically use directories like dist or out. For our example, we'll type `.` (dot) which means current, as we've changed directory to **~/fleek-quick-start**.

```sh
Please specify the directory containing the site files to be uploaded > .
```

Typically, most JavaScript projects have a build command to generate the distribution files, e.g. `npm run build`. We can reply "n", as we'll deploy a simple html page.

```sh
Would you like to include the optional "build" command? â€º n
```

When asked which format to save the Fleek Site configuration, select your favourite format. Here we're keeping it simple and choose JSON.

```sh
Select a format for saving the site's configuration > JSON
```

On success, you should get a confirmation message.

```sh
âœ… Success! The Fleek configuration file has been successfully saved
```

## Deploy Fleek site

To deploy your site, simply run the sites deploy command in the directory where you've set up the site.

```sh
fleek sites deploy
```

```sh
> Site IPFS Content Identifier (CID): QmbAwexQq1wqk9XZEzZs6CycbARDEp42ZRg5tUHp1XW2RQ
ðŸ’¡ You can access it through the gateway:
ðŸ”— https://<SLUG>.on-fleek.app
```

You can access your Fleek Site through the Fleek Gateway at `https://<SLUG>.on-fleek.app`. Alternatively, you can configure your own gateway or use others, including the main IPFS gateway at <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/YOUR-CID">https://ipfs.io/ipfs/YOUR-CID</a>
