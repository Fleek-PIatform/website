# Fleek Infrastructure

Over the next few months, we will be exposing more of our Fleek Network infrastructure within the platform.

## What is Fleek Network?

Fleek Network is lightning-fast on-chain cloud infrastructure that provides highly-performant, edge-optimized cloud and Web services.

It enables developers to work with a high-performance, permissionless, self-sovereign and open-source system requiring no DevOps and at very low cost. This enables developers to spend more time with their codebase and less time on the management of their application.

An overview of Fleek Network can be found on the Fleek Network Web site [here](https://fleek.network)

## Where can I find more information on Fleek Network?

We plan to migrate documentation of our Fleek Network services to this section over the coming weeks. In the meantime, you can find resources related to Fleek network by visiting a separate documentation library we are maintaining [here](https://docs.fleek.network/docs/)
