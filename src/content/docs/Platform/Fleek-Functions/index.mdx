# Fleek Functions

:::note

This feature is in alpha. Until this functionality is finalized, we do not recommend using Fleek Functions in production apps due to changes that may be made during this period. Fleek Functions are currently accessible within the Fleek CLI or the Fleek SDK in this alpha state, but cannot yet be created or managed within the Fleek Platform UI.

:::

Fleek Functions are code snippets that are executed server-side using Fleek Network’s on-chain cloud infrastructure.

These functions are often a more cost-effective, performant and scalable option for executing server-side code than popular alternatives such as Lambda functions, due to the architecture of the Fleek Network. These functions allow users to build cost-effective, low-overhead infrastructure for their applications while also enabling lightning-fast performance.

## Why should I use Fleek Functions in my project?

There are _three_ key benefits to consider when evaluating Fleek Functions for use within your application:

1. **Reduced latency:** The primary advantage of using Fleek Functions over a service you may be familiar with such as AWS’s Lambda functions is its decentralized edge runtime environment, which reduces the latency of your function calls. By running Fleek Functions over an edge-optimized Fleek Network that leverages a large number of geo-located nodes, Fleek minimizes the response time of these functions. And, as more nodes join the Fleek Network, the latency of Fleek Functions will decrease even further.
2. **Reduced overhead:** Because functions are only called on an as-needed basis and there are no servers to manage, Fleek Functions require far less overhead than other self-managed servers or rentals. They allow you to focus on your code, rather than on server infrastructure management.
3. **They auto-scale up and 'to zero':** Users who are in need of minimal resources during low-traffic periods or far more resources during traffic spikes can use precisely the volume of resources that they require, in an auto-scaling model that is maximally cost-effective.

## What can I do with Fleek Functions?

Put simply, you can call Fleek Functions from the front-end of your application just as you would invoke any code that returns a response from a server. Among other things, you can use Fleek Functions to:

- Implement server-side rendering (SSR) for your entire application
- Call APIs to retrieve or populate data on the user interface
- Make routing requests

:::note

During the Fleek Functions alpha, all functions uploaded to Fleek will be public, as we make use of a public storage solution (IPFS) to store their code. Once we move to our beta release, we will support private functions, logs, and metrics. Prior to the beta, please exercise caution and avoid sending sensitive data of any kind through Fleek Functions.

## Do I need to use Fleek Functions for my Fleek project, or is Fleek able to support dynamic sites that do not use Fleek Functions?

Prior to the release of Fleek Functions, Fleek was able to support users’ dynamic sites, but by necessity users were required to manage their back-end services outside of Fleek.

Fleek can now support dynamic sites without requiring users to manage this aspect of their application elsewhere, but even in the wake of Fleek Functions’ release, it is not required.

Users still have the option of self-managing their servers or managing their back-end code through another provider. We believe Fleek Functions offer benefits over these alternatives, but do not require their exclusive use or prevent users from exploring other solutions.

# Moving Fleek Functions from alpha to production

While this feature is in alpha, there are some important caveats about its functionality, chiefly that this feature is not yet accessible within the platform UI.

## Where to use Fleek Functions in alpha

Today Fleek Functions can only be created and managed within Fleek's CLI and SDK, but soon we plan to integrate this functionality into the platform UI as well. When we do roll out Fleek Functions within the platform UI, you will find this functionality under the “Functions” tab of your project page, which currently serves as a placeholder and directs users to the information found here.

## How to use Fleek Functions in alpha

While the Fleek Functions feature is in alpha and until a future date when its functionality has been finalized, we do not recommend relying on Fleek Functions within production applications. In the interim, we encourage our users to experiment with the addition of Fleek Functions to hobby projects or sandboxes. We invite users to preview the performance and cost benefits of Fleek Functions in a controlled environment such as this to assuage any doubts about its future value to a production application.

## Later: Supporting common use cases with communal Fleek Functions

We plan to improve and solidify this feature based on feedback from the community, but to also explore ways that the community can directly contribute shared communal Fleek Functions. Developers building on Fleek often require custom back-end code to facilitate the bespoke needs of their application and users, but just as certain utility `npm` packages like `lodash` attract installs into millions of unique repos, some Fleek Functions will fulfill a need shared by a preponderance of Fleek users. An example of one such Fleek Function might be one that call the OpenWeatherMap API and returns the current temperature of the requested city.

If these functions were created in isolation, they would often duplicate the work of other community members. One might be a less battle-tested, elegant solution to the same problem another user has encountered.

Users are under no obligation to publish Fleek Functions, but we plan to highlight open-source contributions from Fleek users that we believe may be valuable to our community at large. Just as we currently highlight useful templates for users building their applications with specific frameworks and an [`awesome-fleek`](https://github.com/fleekxyz/awesome-fleek) directory of useful tools built on Fleek, we anticipate there may be value in organizing a directory of boilerplate but configurable Fleek Functions that have widespread applicability to our users’ projects.

## Release timeline for Fleek Functions

We look forward to seeing the Fleek Functions our users create and share. We believe Fleek Functions collectively represent one of the more significant value unlocks for our users since Fleek’s inception, given that it is one of the first of our features to leverage the Fleek Network.

As of today, Fleek Functions will move through the following phases:

- Alpha Release: Fleek Functions can be created and managed through the Fleek CLI and SDK, but cannot be accessed through the Fleek Platform UI. They are not recommended for production-grade applications.
- Beta Release: Following rigorous testing, we will move Fleek Functions to a beta state. We will still advise caution when integrating Fleek Functions into production applications at this stage, but they will be nearing their production release and thus will be less likely to change or produce unexpected side effects.
- Production Release: The Fleek Platform UI will support the creation and management of Fleek Functions. Fleek Functions will leave beta and be recommended for production applications. We will begin facilitating a community-created directory of open-source Fleek Functions.

# Creating and using Fleek Functions

To create your first Fleek Function, you must first write the code behind the Fleek Function and then subsequently set configuration settings for the function's deployment. Step-by-step instructions follow below.

## Install the Fleek CLI

To use Fleek Functions, you first must have the Fleek CLI installed. You can run the following command to install it.

```js
npm i -g @fleekxyz/cli
```

## Then, write the code for the function you want to run from a Fleek Function

Here, we have created a new file called `function.js` that as a single export, the function `main`. Note the use of the params object, which will include the request data sent whenever this function is called.

```js
export const main = (params) => {
  return 'hello world';
};
```

## Name the Fleek Function, then create it

Decide on a `<function_name>` that is a unique identifier amongst Fleek Functions in your project. This should be descriptive so that you can identify it if you later create a large number of Fleek Functions within the same project (e.g. `print-hello-world`for the example function above.) Note that this name you give your Fleek Function does not have to be the same as the export name in the code file (i.e., `main` in `function.js`), provided there is only one export in the file.

After replacing `<fleek_function_name>` with the name you are giving the Fleek Function, run the following command:

```js
fleek functions create --name <fleek_function_name>

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek functions create --name print-hello-world
*/
```

## Deploy the Fleek Function

To deploy the Fleek Function, run the following command, but:

- Replace `<function_name>` with your Fleek Function name (i.e. `print-hello-world`)
- Replace `<code_path>` with the path from your current directory to the one where the file (i.e. `function.js`) is saved.

```js
fleek functions deploy --name <fleek_function_name> --path <code_path>

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek functions deploy --name print-hello-world --path *./function.js
*/
```

## After running this command, use the provided URL to make a request to the Fleek Function

After running the `deploy` command from the last step, if your deployment is successful, you'll see a message notifying you that you can create a new function invocation by making a request to the following URL, a URL that will look like `https://<slug>.functions.<env>.on-fleek.app` and will be unique to this Fleek Function.

You can then visit the URL or make a request to the URL in order to run your Fleek Function.

## How do I see all of the Fleek Functions I have deployed?

You can list all of the Fleek Functions you have deployed, across each of your Fleek projects, by running the following command:

```js
fleek functions list
```

This will print a table showing the ID, name, project slog and Fleek Function invocation URL for each of your Fleek Functions.

## What do I do if I want to make changes to the code a particular Fleek Function is running?

The code for a particular _deployment_ of a Fleek Function is immutable once the function is deployed, but that does not prevent you from editing the source file with changes and triggering a new deployment of the updated Fleek Function while preserving its original name. In this way, if you were to modify the code snippet used by a Fleek Function named `prints-hello-world` to add a comma to the output between ‘Hello’ and ‘World’ in the output, calling `prints-hello-world` would then output that comma each time you called the Fleek Function with that name.

To update the code for a Fleek Function, you will need to edit the file with your code snippet and deploy the Fleek Function. We recommend using the same name for the Fleek Function in this case to group iterations of the same function. These will be differentiated not only by the code they run (in the event you’ve edited the code snippet you used to create it) but also in the Fleek Function’s unique ID.

If you want to see all of the deployments of a Fleek Function, you can run the following command, replacing `<fleek_function_name>` with the name of the Fleek Function you want information on:

```js
fleek function deployments --name <fleek_function_name>

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek function deployments --name prints-hello-world
/*
```

This will print a table showing the ID, CID and creation timestamp for each of your Fleek Functions with the name you provided in the command.

## How can I make use of my Fleek Functions?

You can make requests to Fleek Functions by requesting information from its URL with most HTTP methods (’GET,’ ‘POST’, ‘HEAD,’ ‘PUT’, ‘DELETE’, and ‘PATCH’).

Every Fleek Function has access to a `params` object which contains the information sent from the user in the request (method, path, headers, query, body). In this way, Fleek Functions can respond to inputs provided by the user in order to return a particular output.

An example of a simple Fleek Function can be found here: https://shallow-dress-hundreds.functions.dev.on-fleek-test.app/. The Fleek Function deployed to this URL is a pure function that simply returns the `params` object.

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 2,
  "title": "quis ut nam facilis et officia qui",
  "completed": false
}
```

Visiting [shallow-dress-hundreds.functions.dev.on-fleek-test.app](http://shallow-dress-hundreds.functions.dev.on-fleek-test.app) is equivalent to calling this Fleek Function using the GET request method. Other use cases would require the function address to be called with different request methods:

- A Fleek Function called with the `post` method might be used to update a status on a social networking application.
- A Fleek Function called with the `patch` method might be used to reset a password.

# Updating existing Fleek Functions

Once you’ve deployed a Fleek Function, you are able to modify the following properties:

- Its `status` (`ACTIVE` , `INACTIVE`)
- Its `fleek_function_name` (the identifier of this Fleek Function)
- Its `slug_name` (the parent grouping of this Fleek Function)

## Name or slug updates

You may wish to give an existing Fleek Function a different name if the code it runs now serves a different purpose than what the name initially described. You can update a Fleek Function’s name by running the following command, replacing `<fleek_function_name>` with the old name for the Fleek Function and `<new_fleek_function_name>` with the new name for the Fleek Function.

```js
fleek functions update --functionName <fleek_function_name> --name <new_fleek_function_name>

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek function update --functionName prints-hello-world --name prints-goodbye-world
/*
```

Similarly, you can update the “slug” of the Fleek Function (which is most often used to group Fleek Functions under the umbrella of a project), by running this command, replacing `<new_slug>` with the new slug you’re interested in assigning to the Fleek Function and `<fleek_function_name>` with the Fleek Function you’re interested in updating.

```js
fleek functions update --functionName <fleek_function_name> --slug <new_slug>

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek function update --functionName prints-hello-world --slug my-project
/*
```

## Status updates

At times you may wish to deactivate a Fleek Function that is no longer relevant to your project, most likely because you will not be using a particular function in your code where you were previously and its inclusion in the list of printed Fleek Functions for the project becomes a source of confusion. You aren’t interested in deleting the Fleek Function outright, however, because it may be useful in the future.

To _deactivate_ such a Fleek Function, you can run the command below, replacing <fleek_function_name></fleek_function_name> with the name of the Fleek Function you’re deactivating.

```js
fleek functions update --functionName <fleek_function_name> --status INACTIVE

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek functions update --functionName prints-hello-world --status INACTIVE
/*
```

To _reactivate_ a Fleek Function you previously activated, simply run the same command but with the label `ACTIVE` after the status flag:

```js
fleek functions update --functionName <fleek_function_name> --status ACTIVE

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek functions update --functionName prints-hello-world --status ACTIVE
/*
```

:::note

These update commands will update the _existing deployment_ of a Fleek Function rather than triggering an additional deployment.

:::

# Deleting a Fleek Function

If you determine that a Fleek Function is no longer useful to you or your project, you can delete it outright by running the following command, replacing `<fleek_function_name>` with the Fleek Function you’re deleting:

```js
fleek functions delete --name <fleek_function_name>

/*
In this example, you would enter:
fleek functions delete --name prints-hello-world
/*
```
