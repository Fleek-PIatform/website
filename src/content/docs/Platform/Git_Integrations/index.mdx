# Git Integrations With Fleek

Fleek allows for automatic deployment on push to your repository, and provides a variety of tools to manage your application from your preferred interface.
Updates pushed to the project-linked repository are automatically deployed through Fleek, and the triggers behind this can be controlled on a granular level through Fleek platform settings.

Fleek allows for automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the production branch of your [GitHub](./docs/git_integrations/fleek-for-github) projects.

:::info
This feature is still behind a feature flag and not yet available to all Fleek users. If you would like to try it out, please [reach out to us](./requests/new/).
:::

Using Git with Fleek offers numerous benefits which includes:

- Automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the production branch of your GitHub projects.
- The ability to manage your deployments from an interface you are already familiar with. With insights on details and deployment logs.
- Settings for deployment like managing environment variables, custom domains, and more.

The supported provider for now is [GitHub](https://github.com/), but we are working on adding support for other Git providers in the future.

## How to set up Git Integrations
