# Git Integrations With Fleek

Fleek allows for automatic deployment on push to your repository, and provides a variety of tools to manage your application from your preferred interface.
Updates pushed to the project-linked repository are automatically deployed through Fleek, and the triggers behind this can be controlled on a granular level through Fleek platform settings.

Fleek allows for automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the production branch of your [GitHub](./docs/git_integrations/fleek-for-github) projects.

Using Git with Fleek offers numerous benefits which includes:

- Automatic deployments on every branch push and merges onto the production branch of your GitHub projects.
- The ability to manage your deployments from an interface you are already familiar with. With insights on details and deployment logs.
- Settings for deployment like managing environment variables, custom domains, and more.

The supported provider for now is [GitHub](https://github.com/), but we are working on adding support for other Git providers in the future.

## Deploying Git Repositores with Fleek

Fleek allows deployments of Git repositories from all Git providers and it is able to select specific branches (typically `main`) to deploy from when set up.
It is an easy process to deploy repositories into production.

Once your site is deployed, Fleek offers several customization options to make your site more personal and professional. You can link a custom domain to your deployed site, providing a branded and memorable web address. Additionally, Fleek supports the integration of Ethereum Name Service (ENS) domains, allowing for a decentralized web address that aligns with the Web3 ethos. For those who prefer a simpler option, you can also edit the random name slug generated by Fleek, giving your site a more human-readable URL thatâ€™s easy to share and remember.

In essence, Fleek simplifies the deployment process while offering robust customization options, making it an excellent choice for developers looking to bring their Git-based projects into production quickly and efficiently.
