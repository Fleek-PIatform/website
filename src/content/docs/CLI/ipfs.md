### What is IPFS?

The Interplanetary File system (IPFS) is a distributed file storage protocol that allow computers all over the globe to store and serve files as part of a giant peer-to-peer network.

### What is Pinning?

Pinning is a mechanism that allows you to tell IPFS to store and keep a given object somewhere - the default being you local node, though in this case you will be pinning the object to Fleekâ€™s IPFS node.

### How to pin a file

You can pin a file from your file system by using the `add` command.

```bash copy
fleek ipfs add <file-direction>
```
### Usage

```bash
fleek ipfs add hello.txt
