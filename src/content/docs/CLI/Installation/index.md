# Installation

This package requires a minimum of Node.js 18. To install the CLI, run:

```bash copy
npm install -g @fleekxyz/cli
```

:::info

Incase this returns an access error (EACCES), run:
```bash copy
sudo npm install -g @fleekxyz/cli
```

:::

### Usage

The Fleek CLI command has the following structure:

```bash copy
fleek <service> <command> [options and parameters]
```

To view all available services and commands, you can use:
```bash copy
fleek help
```

### Authentication

All the services in the Fleek CLI require authentication. To do this, you have to run:

```bash copy
fleek login
```
This will trigger the login process, and we use Web3Auth to manage authentication. Once the flow is completed, you will be greeted like this:

```bash copy
fleek login
üîó Opening browser on https://app.fleek.xyz/login.html?verificationSession=... 
üßë‚Äçüíª Please login to continue
‚úÖ Successfully logged in.
```

If at any point you want to log out, you can do so:

```bash copy
fleek logout
‚úÖ Successfully logged out.
```

### Projects

As explained [here](/docs/Projects), to interact with services, you need to have a project. This can be created and managed via the CLI too!

To create a project, you can do it like this:

```bash copy
fleek projects create
$ ? Enter project name: ‚Ä∫ 
```

When you enter a correct name, you will be automatically switched to it. Additionally, you can switch between different projects using the 'switch' command, which will prompt a selector:

```bash copy
fleek projects switch
‚ùØ   project-1
    project-2
    project-3
```
