1. Double-check your Publish directory: Ensure that you have specified the correct directory containing your website files during the deployment process. Verify that the files you want to publish are located within that directory. Common directories are 'out' , 'dist' , 'public' , etc.

2. Ensure that you have an index.html file (or another entry point file, depending on your setup) in the publish directory that will be generated in the build process.
