The Fleek.xyz platform empowers developers to build lightning-fast web apps, and services that are edge optimized for performance. In this detailed guide, youâ€™ll learn how to deploy a **Next.js** web app using the Fleek.xyz UI and your siteâ€™s **GitHub repo**.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want to deploy your app without having to leave the command line, or without having to use Github, we have a guide that shows you how to deploy your Next.js app to Fleek directly via the [Fleek CLI](https://blog.fleek.xyz/post/fleek-nextjs-guide/).

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that simplifies the creation of server-rendered React applications. It offers features like automatic code splitting, route pre-fetching, and built-in support for server-side rendering and static site generation, enabling faster, more SEO-friendly web development.

# Requirements

- [Fleek Account](http://app.fleek.xyz)
- [GitHub Account](http://github.com)
- Repository of the app youâ€™d like to deploy

> ðŸ’¡ If you donâ€™t have a Next.js app ready to deploy for this guide donâ€™t worryâ€” you can access one through our open-source template repository https://github.com/fleekxyz/nextjs-template, along with a bunch of other framework & protocol templates and boilerplates.

**Letâ€™s get started**:

---

## Fleek Account Creation

The first thing weâ€™ll need to do is create a Fleek account: head over to http://app.fleek.xyz, and click on the `Create a Free Account` button.

> ðŸ’¡ Feel free to skip this step if you already have an account on Fleek.xyz!

Youâ€™ll be prompted to create an account with your wallet or an email address. For the sake of this tutorial, weâ€™ll be making an account using our MetaMask account.

Click on the `Metamask` option from the wallet list and youâ€™ll be presented with a **sign-in** request in your browser extension. This is to verify ownership of your account.

### GitHub Account

Youâ€™ll also need to head over to http://github.com to create an account. For the sake of this tutorial, weâ€™ll be making use of this [repository](https://github.com/fleekxyz/nextjs-template)https://github.com/fleekxyz/nextjs-template. Simply clone this repo onto your account, and we can move to the next step.

## Deploying Site On Fleek

Once we have our repo cloned, the next step is the deployment!

Head over to the dashboardÂ [http://app.fleek.xyz](http://app.fleek.xyz/), Create a new project, give it a name. Youâ€™ll automatically get switched to that project.

![](./ghnextjs3.png)

Click on the `Add New` button at the top right. Then click on `Deploy my site`

Youâ€™ll be brought to this page:

> ðŸ’¡ Support for Gitlab and Bitbucket are underway!

Click on the GitHub icon. Youâ€™ll see a pop-up like this:

Choose the preferred account or organization. This will lead you to a page where you can grant access to either specific repositories or all repositories.

Once youâ€™ve selected the repo(s) you would like to grant Fleek access to, click on `Save`. You should see thisâ€” the image below shows a list of repos Fleek has access to.

> ðŸ’¡ If you want to grant Fleek access to a different repo, simply click on the â€˜**Adjust GitHub App Permission**â€™ button underneath.

The next step will be to click on the â€˜Deployâ€™ button of the repo you would like to deploy to Fleek.

Youâ€™ll then be brought to this page:

A few things to note about this page.

1. You can modify the `Site Name` to anything you want.
2. The framework is automatically detected by Fleek.
3. The `main` branch is automatically selected. If youâ€™d like to deploy code from a different branch, feel free to select that branch.
4. The `Publish Directory` is also automatically determined by Fleek based on the **Default** publish directory by the framework. If youâ€™ve made any modifications to this, change the name to reflect this.
5. The `Build Command` is also automatically determined by Fleek. If this is different from yours, modifications can be made.

### Advanced Options

When you click on the `Show Advanced Options`

You can make modifications to things like:

- Docker Image & Tag
- The Base Directory
- The Environmental Variables

Once you are satisfied with the modifications youâ€™ve made, simply click on the `Deploy Site` button to allow Fleek to begin the deployment process.

You will be automatically redirected to this page on the Fleek dashboard:

![](./ghnextjs10.png)

The `Overview` page shows you the status of your site deployment, you can also monitor the status of your deployment by clicking on the `Deploys` tab. The `Audit Log` , `Analytics`, `Settings`, have helpful information about your deployment as well.

Once your site has been successfully deployed, you should see a `Site is live` notification and your siteâ€™s URL.

![](./ghnextjs11.png)

Click on the URL (For this example itâ€™s https://wailing-action-mammoth.on-fleek.app/ but yours will be different) and itâ€™ll take you to your fully functional static NextJs blog!

From theÂ [Fleek.xyz](http://fleek.xyz/)Â dashboard, you have the ability to manage a custom domain or ENS address for your site, as well as see deployment history and quickly manage site settings.

Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully deployed your Next.js App on Fleek!
