You can rapidly bootstrap a React application using [create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev/), and with Fleek, you can deploy it in just a few minutes. In this guide, weâ€™ll go over how to:

1. Create a Fleek Account
2. Clone the react boilerplate GitHub Repo
3. Deploying your app on Fleek

Letâ€™s go!

---

## Prerequisites

- NodeJs 8+
- NPM 5.6+
- Fleek Account

---

## Fleek Deployment

### Step 1: Fleek Account Creation

The first thing weâ€™ll need to do is create a Fleek account: head over to [http://app.fleek.xyz](http://app.fleek.xyz/), and click on the `Create a Free Account` button.

ðŸ’¡ Feel free to skip this step if you already have an account on Fleek.xyz!

Youâ€™ll be prompted to create an account with an email address or a wallet.

Insert your email address in the box below, and click on continue.

A 6-digit verification code will be sent to your email. Retrieve it and enter the code in the following modal.

After the code is verified, youâ€™ll be logged in and redirected to the Fleek Dashboard.

## GitHub Account

Youâ€™ll also need to head over to [GitHub](http://github.com/) to create an account.

This is the repository of the react template weâ€™ll be working with and deploying onto Fleek:

https://github.com/fleekxyz/react-template

Simply clone this repo onto your account, and we can move to the next step.

## Deploying Site On Fleek

Once we have our repo cloned, the next step is the deployment!

Head over to the [Fleek dashboard](http://app.fleek.xyz/), Create a new project, and give it a name. Youâ€™ll be automatically switched to that project.

![](./create.png)

Click on the `Add New` button at the top right. Then click on `Deploy my site`

Youâ€™ll be brought to this page:

ðŸ’¡ Support for Gitlab and Bitbucket are underway!

Click on the GitHub icon. Youâ€™ll see a pop-up like this:

Choose the preferred account or organization. This will lead you to a page where you can grant access to either specific repositories or all repositories.

Once youâ€™ve selected the repo(s) you would like to grant Fleek access to, click `Save`. You should see thisâ€” the image below shows a list of repos Fleek has access to.

ðŸ’¡ To grant Fleek access to a different repository, simply click on the â€˜Adjust GitHub App Permissionâ€™ button below.

The next step will be to click on the â€˜Deployâ€™ button of the repository you would like to deploy to Fleek.

Youâ€™ll then be brought to this page:

A few things to note about this page.

1. You can modify the `Site Name` to anything you want.
2. The framework is automatically detected by Fleek.
3. The `main` branch is automatically selected. If youâ€™d like to deploy code from a different branch, feel free to select that branch.
4. The `Publish Directory` is also automatically determined by Fleek based on the **Default** publish directory by the framework. If youâ€™ve made any modifications, change the name to reflect this.
5. The `Build Command` is also automatically determined by Fleek. If this is different from yours, modifications can be made.

### Advanced Options

When you click on the `Show Advanced Options`

You can make modifications to things like:

- Docker Image & Tag
- The Base Directory
- The Environmental Variables

Once you are satisfied with the modifications youâ€™ve made, simply click on the `Deploy Site` button to allow Fleek to begin the deployment process.

You will be automatically redirected to this page on the Fleek dashboard:

![](./deploying.png)

The `Overview` page shows you the status of your site deployment, you can also monitor the status of your deployment by clicking on the `Deploys` tab. The `Audit Log` , `Analytics`, `Settings`, have helpful information about your deployment as well.

Once your site has been successfully deployed, you should see a `Site is live` notification and your siteâ€™s URL.

Click on the URL (For this example itâ€™s https://wailing-action-mammoth.on-fleek.app/ but yours will be different) and itâ€™ll take you to your fully functional React App!

**Congratulations! Youâ€™ve successfully deployed your react App onto Fleek!**
