<u>[Vitalik Buterin‚Äôs website](https://vitalik.eth.limo/index.html)</u> has been a community-favorite resource for blockchain and web3 knowledge since its inception. It contains valuable information on the Ethereum roadmap and technical deep dives on all sorts of concepts relevent to the onchain ecosystem as a whole‚Äì **but, did you know all of this is deployed on Fleek?**

The blog website follows a minimal UI with focus on loading pages quickly and rendering markdown. The template for the blog is open source and can be found <u>[here](https://github.com/vbuterin/blogmaker)</u>.

In this tutorial, we will be showing you how to fork this template and deploy your own Vitalik-inspired blog on Fleek. Towards the end, we will also help you deploy this template in one-click using <u>[Fleek's template gallery](https://app.fleek.xyz/templates/)</u>.

## Requirements

- An account on <u>[app.fleek.xyz](https://app.fleek.xyz/)</u>
- <u>[Python](https://www.python.org/)</u> installed locally
- <u>[PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)</u> installed locally
- <u>[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html) installed</u>
- A <u>[Github](https://github.com/)</u> Account
- Code editor

> ‚ö†Ô∏è: You only need to install Python, PIP and Pandoc if you want to compile the site locally. You can also skip these and just edit the blogs. Upon Deployment, Fleek will take care of compiling the site for you.

## Setup

1. Start by forking <u>[Vitalik‚Äôs repository](https://github.com/vbuterin/blogmaker)</u>

![](./repo.png)

2. Now in an empty directory, clone the forked blogmaker project as follows-

```
mkdir blog
cd blog
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/blogmaker.git
```

Great job! You now have blogmaker website locally setup on your system.

## Adding Blogs and Compiling Locally

Let‚Äôs now explore how we can add more blogs to this website and compile markdown to HTML to render the complete website-

1. Head over to the posts folder and create a new file called `newblog.md`

2. Add the following content to `newblog.md` -

```
[category]: <> (test)
[date]: <> (2024/07/19)
[title]: <> (my blog)

<!--- content goes here --->
This is a new blog post!
```
Each blog post contains the following properties -

- **Category**: this defines the category to which your blog posts belong. It is particularly useful in sorting and arranging blogs in the longer run.
- **Date:** this helps arrange all blog posts chronologically
- **Title**:This is the title of the blog post

>üí°: Please note that you can change the content here as per your needs.

3. Once you are done adding content to your new blog, run the following command in your terminal to compile all new markdown based blogs to HTML and add them to the main HTML file. This will edit the site folder and prepare it for hosting on Fleek -

```
./publish.py posts/*
```

This will result into a site directory similar to this -

![](./directory.png)

>‚ö†Ô∏è: If you don't want to compile your site locally, you can skip this step and move to the next one.

4. Finally, head over to `config.md` and make the following changes to ensure it deploys correctly on Fleek -

```
[title]: <> (Vitalik Buterin's website)
[icon]: <> (http://vitalik.ca/images/icon.png)
[domain](http://localhost:5500)
[posts_directory](./posts)
```

>üí°: You can edit the title and icon here to fit your specifications

- Commit changes and push to GitHub -

```
git add .
git commit -m "feat: new blogs added"
git push origin main
```

Awesome! You have now explored blogmaker properly and added your own blog post to it. Let‚Äôs move forward and deploy it on Fleek.
