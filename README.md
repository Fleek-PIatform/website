[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-blue.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

This repository contains the source code and assets for the Fleek.xyz website, which is built using the [Astro.js framework](https://astro.build) for enhanced performance and speed. The project leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, providing a modern and responsive design, and TypeScript for type safety and scalability, ensuring a robust and maintainable codebase.

# Setup

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Nodejs
- NPM, Yarn or PNPM
- Some experience with CLI

## 🤖 Install

Install the project dependencies in your local environment.

## 👷‍♀️Develop

Start a local HTTP server for development work. It supports hot-reload and you'll be able to see your edits everytime you save the files:

```
npm run dev
```

## 🏗️ Build

Run the build command to create the distribution version. The files will be saved in the `/dist` directory by default.
