# ZenDesk's proxy

The following is the ZenDesk's proxy service.

## Requirements

- Nginx >= 1.24
- SSL/HTTPS

To learn more about Nginx read it [here](https://nginx.org/en/docs)

## Enable SSL

Enable SSL by utilizing the Let's Encrypt which provide free SSL certificates. Use Certbot to automate the process.

1. Make sure that a location block for the acme challenge is set

```
location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
    root /var/www/certbot-challenges;
    allow all;
}
```

2. Enable port 443

```sh
sudo ufw allow 443
```

3. Stop any services on port 80 as it'll be used for the challenge

```sh
systemctl stop nginx
```

4. Install required binaries

Install certbot and the Nginx certbot extension to generate certificates.

```sh
apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
```

5. Generate the certificates

Generate the certificates by following the prompts to complete the SSL setup use the team admin email address during registration.

Run the command for each domain.

```sh
certbot certonly \
  --nginx \
  --standalone \
  -d <DOMAIN>
```

Expect a response similar to the following for each domain blog and docs.

```sh
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/<URL>/fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/<URL>/privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2024-08-25.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.
```

6. Copy the NGINX configuration

You're required to setup the Nginx configuration and related includes such as the shared directory files to the server. By default these should be placed in /etc/nginx.

Make any customizations as required.

7. Declare the SSL Certificates for each domain blog and docs.

```sh
ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/<URL>/fullchain.pem;
ssl_certificate_key  /etc/letsencrypt/live/<URL>/privkey.pem;
```

8. Test

```sh
nginx -t
```

9. Restart the nginx service

```sh
systemctl reload nginx
```

10. Verify

Run the openssl command for the domain.

```sh
openssl s_client -connect <DOMAIN>:443 -servername <DOMAIN>
```

You should find.

```sh
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
subject=CN=<DOMAIN>
issuer=C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=R11
---
```

## Systemd Service

The Service is wrapped as a Systemd service located in:

```
/lib/systemd/system
```

For this reason, any of the systemctl commands should be familiar to manage the Systemd service:

```sh
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start support-prod-eu-lon-1-01.flkservices.io.service
systemctl enable support-prod-eu-lon-1-01.flkservices.io.service
systemctl restart support-prod-eu-lon-1-01.flkservices.io.service
```

Although, it uses [Bun](https://bun.sh/) to run the service.

```sh
bun run <USERNAME>/<REPO>/Services/ZenDesk/api.ts
```

More importantly, the HTTP Server is NGINX. Utilized as a forward proxy to the Systemd or Bun service.

Find the configuration located in:

```sh
/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
```

The following commands should be familiar.

```sh
systemctl status nginx
systemctl reload nginx
```

ðŸ’¡At time of writting, templates are available under the repository path [/Services/ZenDesk](https://github.com/fleek-platform/website/tree/331f5c1b9e75d3e6c580a93bedb612267257bda7/Services/ZenDesk).

## Environment Variables

The service uses environment variables. The local service loads `.env` if available. For `production` server the environment variables are handled by the CI/CD process, you can see the version available at time of writing [here](https://github.com/fleek-platform/website/blob/bd9e11857f741cf22ee79aeaf5c0ad187a27f743/.github/workflows/support-service-update.yml).

Use the [GitHub's Secrets and Variables](https://github.com/fleek-platform/website/settings/secrets/actions) to declare any business logic required environment variables. This is required otherwise the remote service will not have it, thus the service should malfunction.

In order for it to work, an utility script is provided to handle any of the environment variable for us. So, ensure that any new environment variables is included in the file.

```sh
Services/ZenDesk/scripts/add-env-vars
```

Here's an example:

```sh
declare -a envVars=(
  "PRIVATE_ZENDESK_EMAIL"
  "PRIVATE_ZENDESK_API_KEY"
  "PRIVATE_ZENDESK_HOSTNAME"
  "PUBLIC_SUPPORT_API_HOST"
  "SUPPORT_ALLOW_ORIGIN_ADDR"
  "SUPPORT_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MINUTES"
  "SUPPORT_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQ"
  "SUPPORT_RATE_LIMIT_PATHS"
  "NODE_ENV"
)
```

ðŸ‘† Any of the above is declared in the CI/CD GitHub's [Secrets and Variables](https://github.com/fleek-platform/website/settings/secrets/actions) dashboard for the particular environment, e.g. production.

The CI/CD job can be seen in action by opening it in the GitHub dashboard [here](https://github.com/fleek-platform/website/actions/workflows/support-service-update.yml).
